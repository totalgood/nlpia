= GlossaryWe've collected some definitions of some common NLP and ML acronyms and terminology here.footnote:[Bill Wilson at the university of New South Wales in Australia has a more complete one here: https://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~billw/nlpdict.html]You can find some of the tools we used to generate this list in the `nlpia` python package at https://github.com/totalgood/nlpia/blob/master/src/nlpia/transcoders.py:[github.com/totalgood/nlpia]].[template="glossary",id="terms"]Acronyms--------*SVM*:: Support Vector Machine -- a machine learning algorithm usually used for classification*SMO*:: Sequential Minimal Optimization -- a support vector machine training algorithm)*NLU*:: Natural Language Understanding -- often used for recent natural language processing algorithms*NLG*:: Natural Language Generation -- composing text automatically, algorithmically*NLP*:: Natural Language Processing -- you probably know what this one is about by now[template="glossary",id="terms"]Glossary--------*Morphemes*:: Parts of tokens or words that contain meaning in and of themselves. The morphemes that make up a token are collectively called its _morphology_ which can be found using algorithms in packages like SpaCy.footnote:[See the web page titled "Linguistic Features Â· spaCy Usage Documentation" (https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#rule-based-morphology).]
